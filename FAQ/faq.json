        "answer": "If you're writing your first novel, the general rule of thumb for novel writing is a word count in the 80,000 to 100,000 range. While anything over 40,000 words can fall into the novel category, 50,000 is considered the minimum novel length. Anything over 110,000 words is considered too long for a fiction novel. <a href='https://www.masterclass.com/articles/word-count-guide' target='_blank'>Link</a>"
